1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,640
We all have fears. Fear of unknown, fear of known,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,960
fear of losing people, fear of losing health,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,640
money. We want to excel in career, we want to

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,680
become famous, we want to get money. We are scared all the time.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,920
So I wrote down one by one all those fears and

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,720
I decided that I'm going to overcome these fears one at a time. You know

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,300
what was my biggest fear? Divorce. I couldn't stand this word.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,740
I was trying to cling onto this person who didn't want me

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,780
anymore, but I said, no, I have to make it work.

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,380
But the day I decided that this is nothing but my fear,

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,820
I liberated myself by setting him free.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,980
And I made myself emotionally so strong that

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,700
the day I got the news that he is getting married, I sent him a

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,460
text that I'm so happy for you and I wish you all the best.
