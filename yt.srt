1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,480
You work hard, you make money,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,000
you do it for yourself. That's not life.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,480
You go out, you seek for people who need your help.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,200
You make their lives better. You become that sponge

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,960
which can absorb all the negativity. And you become that person who can emit beautiful,

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,280
positive vibes. And when you realize that you have changed someone's

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,480
life and because of you, this person didn't give up,

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,520
that is the day when you live.
